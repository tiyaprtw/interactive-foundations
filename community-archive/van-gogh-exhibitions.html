      <h4> Prologue </h4>
      <h5>Van Gogh experienced life and the world intensely and wanted his art to portray the great themes of life, such as anxiety, suffering, love and hope. You follow the on-going search of an artist who was constantly trying to improve himself. In this way, you get a new view of an artist you thought you knew.

      The story of his art is told throughout the galleries, not only giving a permanent position to his paintings but also to his drawings and letters. Important aspects of Van Gogh’s art are highlighted and studied through varying themes. </h5>

      <h5>Van Gogh’s ambition to paint farmers, his search for colour and his personal interpretation of nature are given a prominent place in the museum, naturally featuring highlights like The Potato Eaters, The Bedroom, Sunflowers and Almond Blossom.

      Explore Vincent van Gogh's masterpieces in the museum's exhibitions. See his development as an artist in the museum galleries. Get to know his ideas and ambitions and step into Van Gogh's world. </h5>
